    <!--Recipe content-->
    <p>One of the best things about the taco bowl recipe is how easily customizable it is! 
        Below is a list of my suggested ingredients, but feel free to mix and match the toppings
         of your choice. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of white or brown rice</li>
        <li>2-3 lbs of ground beef</li>
        <li>70 g of taco seasoning</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers, thinly diced</li>
        <li>540 mL of canned black beans</li>
        <li>260 mL of canned corn</li>
        <li>500 mL of salsa</li>
        <li>1 bag of tortilla chips</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And the dish is incredibly simple to make! Just follow the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin cooking the rice (ideally, in a rice cooker). Once ready, set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Fry the onions and garlic in a large pot.</li>
        <li>Once the onions are translucent, add the ground beef and cook fully. Drain excess liquid.</li>
        <li>Add approximately one cup of water and the taco seasoning. Stir until the spice has been absorbed.</li>
        <li>Mix in bell peppers, black beans, corn, salsa, salt, and cayenne pepper. Cook for another 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Portion mixture into bowls of rice. Add in crushed tortilla chips.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy! This recipe made me 6 servings. I'd recommend freezing anything you don't plan to eat in the next couple
        days.

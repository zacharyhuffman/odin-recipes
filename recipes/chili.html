    <!--Recipe content-->
    <p>This chili was actually one of my first meal preps, and during the winter, I 
        still go back to it every few weeks. I've listed my recommended ingredients below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs of ground beef</li>
        <li>75 g of chili seasoning</li>
        <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups of beef broth</li>
        <li>1 green pepper, diced</li>
        <li>2 540 mL cans of red kidney beams</li>
        <li>1 540 mL can of black beans</li>
        <li>1 420 mL can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 420 mL can of diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of tomato paste</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To make, just follow the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ground beef and chili seasoning.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, brown ground beef, onion, and garlic. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add in remaining ingredients an bring to a boil. Reduce heat and summer uncovered for 
            45-60 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><b>Enjoy!</b> Yes, it really was that easy!</li>
    </ol>
